Requirements:
https://godotengine.org/download/windows
Standard version install.
I forgot to mention that the "kill" button is located (5 x , 0 z) and that the "resurrect" button is located (-5 x , 0 z).
And also if you don't use windows you might need to re-export the game for the OS that you use, if you use windows however it is already exported.
