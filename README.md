Version 1.0.0 Initial Release:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/ais1datgs8s18ey/my-first-game-COMPLETE.zip?dl=0
Requirements:
https://godotengine.org/download
Standard version install.
I forgot to mention that the "kill" button is located (5 x , 0 z) and that the "resurrect" button is located (-5 x , 0 z).
And also if you don't use windows you might need to re-export the game for the OS that you use, if you use windows however it is already exported.

Version 1.1.0 A Minor Update:

I included the information I missed
I added all export options
I added Color Reskins and a backup folder for it

Version 1.2.0 An Even More Minor Update:

I added a background

Version 1.2.1 A Bug Fix:

I fixed the bug where it says "X,Y,Z" (and then switches upon cursor movement) where your coordinates are so now it says "X, Y, Z" (from the start)
